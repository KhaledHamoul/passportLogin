# what is passport

<p>Passport is authentication middleware for Node. It is designed to serve a singular purpose: authenticate requests.</p>
When writing modules, encapsulation is a virtue, so Passport delegates all other functionality to the application. </p>
<p>This separation of concerns keeps code clean and maintainable, and makes Passport extremely easy to integrate into an application.</p>
<strong>this app is a complete login system using passport local strategy</strong>
